# PiWebThermometer
One-trick-pony Python HTTP server giving temperature readings every 30 seconds from a DS18B20 sensor on Raspberry Pi

Came up with it as a simple way to remotely check the temperature in my toddler's room on the smartphone.

Getting started with DS16B28 at http://www.modmypi.com/blog/ds18b20-one-wire-digital-temperature-sensor-and-the-raspberry-pi.
Follow the instructions to have it all configured before using the program.

Just launch the script and point the browser to http://<pi_address>:8000.
